India Air Quality Analysis and Prediction
Module Information

Module: CMP7005 – Programming for Data Analysis

Assessment: PRAC1

Academic Year: 2025–2026

Project Summary

This project analyses air quality data collected from multiple Indian cities between 2015 and 2020 and develops a data-driven application to explore and predict Air Quality Index (AQI) values. The work demonstrates practical programming, data analysis, and machine learning skills using Python.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning model development and evaluation, and deployment through an interactive Streamlit web application.

Key Components

Data extraction and merging from multiple CSV files

Data cleaning and feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis and visualisation

Machine learning models for AQI prediction

Interactive Streamlit-based user interface
